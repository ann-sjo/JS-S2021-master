        </div>
        <p>This page has XML data embedded into it. See page source, line 78. The browser cannot display it properly, but its there. Below you can also see the structure data. Write a function called parseData(), which 
        will output the quote and author tags from XML when button is clicked. Hint: Use document.getElementsByTagName() function. See PowerPoint for reference.</p>
