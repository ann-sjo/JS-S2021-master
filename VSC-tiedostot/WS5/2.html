    <h2>Exercise 2: Membership Calculator</h2>
    <p data-line="16">Below there is a membership calculator form. It has 3 fields: 
    Membership Type (pulldown), Years (input) and Costs (input). User can use the 
    pulldown to select which plan user wants to choose (Basic = 10€, Premium=15€,   
    Gold=20€) and then enter the number of years he wants to pay for.</p>
    <p data-line="20">Update the code of the form so that:</p>
    <p data-line="20">a)  the Costs-field should display the total costs of the 
    subscription</p>
    <p data-line="22">b) If the user chooses to pay for more than 2 years, he will get a 
    20% discount. Notify the user when he is eligible to get the discount, by showing a text 
    next to form.</p>
    <p data-line="24">c) Should he pay for 5 years or more, he will get the normal 20% 
    discount, but will also be given an extra 5€ discount with a special greetings text on 
    screen.</p>
